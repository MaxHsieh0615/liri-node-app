# liri-node-app

This is my LIRI bot app. You can use my app to search information of any movies, songs, and dates of concerts. 

Most parts of the app function perfectly. Except the concerts search command. 

Due to the fact that I did not get to solve the problem of not getting data from bandsintown server so I have to disable it before I fix it. I disabled it so the app can run smoothly when users type in their command looking for information of songs or movies.


## Below are the screenshots examples of the results after typing in the node liri.js <song/movie/band> in terminal
